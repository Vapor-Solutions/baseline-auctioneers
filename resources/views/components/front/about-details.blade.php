                    <p>Baseline Auctioneers was founded in October 1995 by Richard N. Nyariki, and our journey has been
                        one of continuous growth and achievement. We started as Auctioneers Class A and have since
                        elevated ourselves to the pinnacle of our field, reaching Class B, the highest classification an
                        auctioneer can attain. This remarkable progress reflects our unwavering commitment to
                        excellence.</p>
                    <p>As we've expanded our reach, we now operate in a broad spectrum of regions,
                        including Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru, Kiambu, Kajiado, Machakos, Kwale, and Taita Taveta counties.
                        Notably, our expertise extends nationwide, particularly in assignments such as the sale of
                        immovable property and the realization of security assets, where we conduct business all across
                        Kenya. Our rich history is defined by a dedication to professionalism and a passion for serving
                        our clients with the highest level of expertise and integrity..</p>
